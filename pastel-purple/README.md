## Pastel-Purple

In line 27, marked by the many # at the end of the line, you need to manually type the path to your wallpaper.

## How-To

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrick-men/i3-rices.git
cd pastel-purple/dotfiles
cp . ~/.config
```
If you want to use the same wallpaper, you can either move it out of .config, or leave it there.
