# i3-rices

A small collection of the little ricing I do. This is mostly used with i3 tabbed mode.

## Dependencies:

- i3-gaps (DE)
- picom (Transparency)
- polybar (Taskbar)
- i3-lock/i3-lock-fancy (Screen Locking)
- feh (Wallpaper)
- dunst (Notifications Daemon)
- terminator (Terminal Emulator)

All the files are to be put in ~/.config
